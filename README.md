New Moon Theme for Sublime
===========================
**New Moon is also available for Brackets! [Check it out!](https://github.com/taniarascia/new-moon)**
*Update 10/27/15 Now available for Sublime Text!*

This theme was created to be optimized for front end web development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP/Wordpress. It's a low contrast dark theme using color inspiration from Tomorrow Night Eighties, and style inspiration from Twilight. 

Most of the dark themes I tried using were distracting and overly colorful and contrast heavy, especially with PHP embedded into HTML. The New Moon theme strives to remedy that, with a theme that is pleasant to view in any language.
